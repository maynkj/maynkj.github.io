      Hi! My name is Mayn Ektvedt Kjær. I'm a developer in growth. I've participated in the first
      <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> batch. Thanks
      to that I've been able to work in my own product for the last 6 months. A job board based
      on GitHub profiles: <a href="http://jobs.punchgirls.com/">http://jobs.punchgirls.com/</a>.
