      <h1>Mayn Ektvedt Kjær</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a norwegian developer in growth, living in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was one of the lucky participants
        of the first <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> batch.
        Thanks to them I was able to work on my own product for the last 6 months. An Open Source job board based
        on GitHub profiles: <a href="http://jobs.punchgirls.com/">http://jobs.punchgirls.com/</a>.
